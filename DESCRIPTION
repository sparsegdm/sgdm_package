Description: Sparse generalized dissimilarity modeling is a two-stage method consisting of initially reducing the environmental data by means of a sparse canonical correlation analysis, to then fit the resulting sparse canonical components in a generalized dissimilarity model (gdm). The package also includes additional tools, useful for both gdm and sgdm.
