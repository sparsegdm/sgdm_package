Description: Sparse generalized dissimilarity modeling (SGDM) is a two-stage method consisting of initially reducing the environmental data by means of a sparse canonical correlation analysis, to then fit the resulting sparse canonical components in a generalized dissimilarity model (GDM). The package also includes additional tools, useful for both GDM and SGDM.
